    <h1>Underworld Office</h1>
    <p id="paragraph1">The snow-covered town of Etobicoke sparkled under the soft glow of festive lights, and the joyous melodies of carolers echoed through the air. Yet, beneath the veneer of holiday cheer, a chilling mystery loomed. You - Detective Jacopo - a renowned detective known for solving seasonal enigmas, received an intriguing invitation to ECI Manor, a grand estate that had been closed off for years.</p>
    <p id="paragraph2">As you enter the school and journey through classrooms adorned with mistletoe and wreaths, encounter furnitures from the town's past, each holding a piece of the puzzle. Tread carefully through the frosty corridors, for every jingle bell and twinkling light holds a clue to the Yuletide enigma.</p>
    <p id="paragraph3">Can you unwrap the mystery, find the key, and unlock the joyous magic behind the door to save Christmas that has long been lost at ECI?</p>
